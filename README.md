# Phone-Directory

This is a project I worked on with some classmates

This program, written in C++, reads in a directory from the data.txt file
and writes it into a linked list. The user can then add, change, remove, or display
the directory. As the program closes, the directory is written back into the data.txt file
and the linked list is emptied.
